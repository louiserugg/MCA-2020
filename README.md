## Task 1: Dataset Theme
The theme of my dataset is the English rock band called "Muse". The band is comprised of three members: Matthew Bellamy (lead guitarist, vocalist, and pianist), Chris Wolstenholme (bassist, and backing vocalists), and Dominic Howard (drummer). They are sub-classified as mainly progressive rock, and play music with melody and fast tempo. However, they also play a great number of other styles of music, especially on their older albums like Showbiz. Their albums, Black Holes and Revelations, Absolution and The Resistance, have been successful in the United States, the United Kingdom and most western countries of the world.


## Task 2: Current Manifestations of Data Relating to My Dataset

**Descriptive Data**

On their official website you can find various descriptive data ranging from information about the albums, links to all the platforms where the music is available. Their music is available on all big music streaming services including Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer where it is normally organised into albums, often into “essentials” playlists which consist of their most listened tracks, can be added to the user-made playlists etc. On Spotify they have a 'This is Muse' playlist with all the essential and most popular Muse songs. Moreover, these music streaming services can make recommendations of “new music” or “you may also like” music to its users which they do with Muse as well. All of this is possible due to the descriptive data they have stored in the background based on which they can categorise, organise, compare and recommend their songs.


**Notated Data**

When it comes to notated music, it is possible to find sheet music for most of their songs on numerous online digital sheet music catalogues such as musicnotes.com which is the biggest of its kind. Apart from offering notated music, it allows the users to filter the files by title, artist, album and scoring as well as chose the preferred instruments.

**Acoustic Data**

Acoustic data can be found on all major streaming services like Spotify and iTunes as well as YouTube where it is published both on the band’s official channel and on other channels as live concerts, lyrics videos, fan covers etc.
