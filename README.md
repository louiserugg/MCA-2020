## Task 1: Dataset Theme
The theme of my dataset is the English rock band called "Muse". The band is comprised of three members: Matthew Bellamy (lead guitarist, vocalist, and pianist), Chris Wolstenholme (bassist, and backing vocalists), and Dominic Howard (drummer). They are sub-classified as mainly progressive rock, and play music with melody and fast tempo. However, they also play a great number of other styles of music, especially on their older albums like Showbiz. Their albums, Black Holes and Revelations, Absolution and The Resistance, have been successful in the United States, the United Kingdom and most western countries of the world.


## Task 2: Current Manifestations of Data Relating to My Dataset

**Descriptive Data**

**Notated Data**

When it comes to notated music, it is possible to find sheet music for most of their songs on numerous online digital sheet music catalogues such as musicnotes.com which is the biggest of its kind. Apart from offering notated music, it allows the users to filter the files by title, artist, album and scoring as well as chose the preferred instruments.

**Acoustic Data**

Acoustic data can be found on all major streaming services like Spotify and iTunes as well as YouTube where it is published both on the bandâ€™s official channel and on other channels as live concerts, lyrics videos, fan covers etc.
