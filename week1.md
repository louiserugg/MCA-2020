# Week 2: Notated Music

For this week's task, I have decided to transcribe Muse's song Starlight. This specific arrangement was arranged Irene Lopez and can be accessed on MuseScore [here](https://musescore.com/iredecharire/scores/4550736). Originally, the arrangement is for a piano and a violin, but I have transcribed it to be for a piano and voice. 

Below are screenshots of png versions of my MuseScore file.
