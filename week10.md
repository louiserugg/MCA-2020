# Week 10: Audio Similarity and Transcription

## Task 1: Generating a Similarity Matrix

For this part of the task, I have used the same tracks from the previous 2 weeks. In the similarity matrix, tracks 0-3 fall within the classical genre, tracks 4-6 fall within the rock genre, and tracks 7-9 are my own tracks. Track 7 is Creative Design, and is classified as Synth Pop, track 8 is Ginger Underground and falls within Jazz, while track 9 is Playing With Shadows and is classified as Ambient Electronic. The matrix reflects this as tracks 4-6 and track 9 are more similar to each other than any other tracks. Tracks 0-3 are also similar to track 8.

## Task 2: Transcription

For this task, I have decided to transcribe the file I generated in week 2, that is, my Starlight file. This was done by first exporting the MuseScore file into a wav file, then importing it into Sonic Visualiser and transforming it into a piano roll which was exported as a MIDI file. The MIDI file was then opened by MuseScore and exported as an image.
