# Week 10: Audio Similarity and Transcription

## Task 1: Generating a Similarity Matrix

For this part of the task, I have used the same tracks from the previous 2 weeks. In the similarity matrix, tracks 0-3 fall within the classical genre, tracks 4-6 fall within the rock genre, and tracks 7-9 are my own tracks. Track 7 is Creative Design, and is classified as Synth Pop, track 8 is Ginger Underground and falls within Jazz, while track 9 is Playing With Shadows and is classified as Ambient Electronic. The matrix reflects this as tracks 4-6 and track 9 are more similar to each other than any other tracks. Tracks 0-3 are also similar to track 8.

## Task 2: Transcription

For this task, I have decided to transcribe the file I generated in week 2, that is, my Starlight file. This was done by first exporting the MuseScore file into a wav file, then importing it into Sonic Visualiser and transforming it into a piano roll which was exported as a MIDI file. The MIDI file was then opened by MuseScore and exported as an image.

## First, here is the original transcription:

## Here is the exported file:

![alt text](https://github.com/louiserugg/MCA-2020/blob/master/starlight_poly-2.png "Starlight Poly 2")

There is a huge difference between these two files. The first difference is that the automatically transcribed file has the entire song written in two staves, while the original file has a voice staff and and 2 staves for the piano. Secondly, the tempo of the transcribed file is different than that of the original file. The time signature is different, the key is also different and not a single bar looks the same.
When it comes to how both files sound, they sound vastly different. There are some parts of the transcribed file which sound similar to the original file, like the main tune is vaguely the same.
