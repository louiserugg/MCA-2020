# Week 3: Encoding Notated Music

## Task 1: Generating MusicXML and MEI files

The first part of this week's task was to export our MuseScore files from last week to a MusicXML file, and from it to an MEI file. 
Both can be accessed through the links below.

Download the MusicXML file [here](starlight_transcribe.musicxml)

Download the MEI file here. [here](uncompressed_starlight.mei)
