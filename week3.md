# Week 3: Encoding Notated Music

## Task 1: Generating MusicXML and MEI files

The first part of this week's task was to export our MuseScore files from last week to a MusicXML file, and from it to an MEI file. 
Both can be accessed through the links below.

Download the MusicXML file [here] (starlight_transcribe.musicxml)

Download the MEI file here.

## Task 2: Rendering the MEI file using Verovio

For the second part of this week's task, I have copied the code from 'verovio.html' file and edited it as needed in order to show my rendered file as a part of this website.
