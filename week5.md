# Week 5: Basic Metadata

## Task 1: Creating a Metadata Scheme

If I were to have 1000 different MEI files in my GitHub repository, these are the metadata elements I would use to describe them as I believe they are the most important:

**Metadata about the original file:**

title (plus an optional subtitle if there is one): name of the transcribed piece

composer: name of the individual(s)/band who created the musical work

lyricist: name of the individual(s)/band who wrote the lyrics

arranger: name of the person/band responsible for the particular arrangement of the piece of music

encoder: name of the individual(s) that encoded the file

source: source from which the file was transcribed

size: physical size of the file itself

publisher: name of the individual/organisation responsible for the publication of the piece of work

publisherâ€™s location: postal address or at least a city of the publisher

date: date of publication

usage restrictions: legal statute of the work regarding its distribution

**Metadata about the encoder/encoding process:**

editorial changes: description of any editorial changes that happened during the transcription of the file

project description: describes the purpose for which the file was created

## Task 2: Modifying the MEI file

The MEI file was updated to contain the above listed metadata and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/louiserugg/MCA-2020/blob/master/modified_starlight.mei).
