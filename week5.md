# Week 5: Basic Metadata

## Task 1: Creating a Metadata Scheme

If I were to have 1000 different MEI files in my GitHub repository, these are the metadata elements I would use to describe them as I believe they are the most important:

### Metadata about the original file:

**Title (plus an optional subtitle if there is one):** name of the transcribed piece

**Composer:** name of the individual(s)/band who created the musical work

**Lyricist:** name of the individual(s)/band who wrote the lyrics

**Arranger:** name of the person/band responsible for the particular arrangement of the piece of music

**Encoder:** name of the individual(s) that encoded the file

**Source:** source from which the file was transcribed

**Size:** physical size of the file itself

**Publisher:** name of the individual/organisation responsible for the publication of the piece of work

**Publisherâ€™s location:** postal address or at least a city of the publisher

**Date:** date of publication

**Usage restrictions:** legal statute of the work regarding its distribution

### Metadata about the encoder/encoding process:

**Editorial changes:** description of any editorial changes that happened during the transcription of the file

**Project description:** describes the purpose for which the file was created

## Task 2: Modifying the MEI file

The MEI file was updated to contain the above listed metadata and can be accessed [here](modified_starlight.mei).
