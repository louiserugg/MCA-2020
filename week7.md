# Week 7: Curation Challenges

## Task 1: Updating last week's metadata

I have updated the last week's metadata scheme by adding information about the genre of the song. That was done by adding the < classification > tag within Work Description, within which I added the < genre > tag. Licensing data was also added as well.

Access the updated file [here](https://github.com/louiserugg/MCA-2020/blob/master/modified_starlight.mei).

## Task 2: Rendering the revised metadata
