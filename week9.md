# Week 9: Analysing and Extracting Meaning from Audio

## Task 1: Extracting Features

For this week's task I used the same tracks from last week's task. Below are the screenshots of the transformations (Spectrogram, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and Chromagram) we had to do in Sonic Visualiser.

#### Histograms computed from chromagrams

I have adapted the Python code to create 12 histograms instead of 20 - one for each pitch class.
